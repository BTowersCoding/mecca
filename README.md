The Music Education Composition Creation Application.

You are the student.

You are the composer.

You are the creator.

Aiming to unify the process of learning, writing and performing music. Because once these are realized as all part of a single activity, life will finally be "but a dream". We must subtly encourage "desirable" musical idioms while preserving maximum expressive potential, like the ultimate teacher who inspires and empowers you, the student, the composer, the creator.

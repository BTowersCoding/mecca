The Music Education Composition Creation Application,
built with Clojure leveraging the Overtone framework and Supercollider engine.
Aiming to present a UI to unify the process of learning, writing and performing music, focusing on custom synth creation based on specific variables to facilitate intuitive acoustic modeling of software instruments.

For example, I often begin a tune with the kick drum, just get it going deep and punchy. But you don't pick a drum hit from a pile of samples, you synthesize them yourself, beginning with a preset and tweaking the parameters as desired.

The balance of holding your hand just enough to tend towards desirable musical idioms without sounding cookie-cutter will, of course, be both critical and customizable. Like the ultimate teacher who inspires and empowers you, the student, the composer, the creator.
